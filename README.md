## video

testing out web-playback HTML5 video via js.

## how

it works solely off of js + html integrations, using `input[type="file"]` buttons and returning through js. take a look if you're interested in [input.js](https://github.com/plexiondev/video/blob/main/js/input.js) and [play.js](https://github.com/plexiondev/video/blob/main/js/play.js)

## running

if you want to try out and run it for yourself, download the source-code and run `index.html` either via a webserver or just running locally.
